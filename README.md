This is a small example of how one might use Mathematica to parse LaTeX expressions in order to detect various characteristics of a mathematical expression (like degree).  It does not yet reflect a variety of edge cases, and was created as part of [the PBLL](https://www.notion.so/An-introduction-to-the-PBLL-624f34255da844228dc1276221d791c9).
